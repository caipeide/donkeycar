# donkeycar: a python self driving library

Donkeycar is minimalist and modular self driving library for Python. This repository originates from https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar. We modify several functions to make it more suitable for the [Autorace project](https://github.com/caipeide/autorace) with application on the *autonomous RC-Car racing competitoin*.
